### Description
In the init file, we import the common, stable submodules I've made. When I started this README, the module `fitsfile` was the only created module, but when I created a repo out of it, I had created `misc` with the function "`mjd()`"

### Submodules

|Submodule|Description|Imported by init file?|
|-|-|-|
|fitsfile|Simple tools for dealing with fits headers, aimed at COS rawtag files initially|Yes|
|misc|Tiny functions like getting a date's modified Julian Day (MJD)|Yes|
